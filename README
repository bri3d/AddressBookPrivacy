Address Book Privacy
====================

This MobileSubstrate Tweak hooks ABAddressBookCopyAllPeople to prevent apps like Path from jacking your Address Book contacts without your permission.

Right now it unconditionally returns an empty array (which surprisingly doesn't break any Apple software - they appear to use AddressBookUI and other APIs to access this information) but eventually I plan to add a permissions list and dialog.
