Address Book Privacy
====================

This MobileSubstrate Tweak hooks ABAddressBookCopyAllPeople to prevent apps like Path from jacking your Address Book contacts without your permission.

When a non-Apple app accesses this method, a UIAlert will appear documenting the attempted access and the hooked function will return an empty array.
